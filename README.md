### Project Structure

The project structure follows recommended practices for a Spring Boot application.

### Code Documentation

Each class and method should have clear responsibilities documented, including details on parameters and return values.

### Business Logic for Banking Operations

- Data validation during account creation and closure (e.g., sufficient balance before closure).
- Exception handling for illegal operations (e.g., attempting to transfer from a closed account).
- Validation of amounts before transfers (e.g., positive amount, sufficient balance).
